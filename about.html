            <p>As a life long artist, color has always been a part of my life. From my youth in Puerto Rico to my adult life in The United States, art and color always seem to reappear. In college, my studies resulted in a degree in biology but I never worked in the field. Instead, I worked as an interpreter/translator for most of my life. Currently Iâ€™m studying web development and painting.</p>
            <p>When I started painting again this time I wanted to brush up on my drawing so I took a couple of courses. During one of these courses I realized how much I enjoyed the perspective drawing exercises.</p>
            <p>Searching for perspective drawings on the internet I came across Zak Korvin, he posts videos on how to draw these shapes and symbols. It got me interested in sacred geometry. One of the first things I learned was that the idea of expressing music geometrically has been around for quite a while.</p>
            <p>That idea, and knowing that the geometric expression of nature has been proven, made me think that color could also be expressed geometrically. On this site, and on the accompanying social media (below), I will post my progress as I explore the boundary between color and geometry.</p>
