            <p>I was born in Puerto Rico and raised in the States. I went to high school in NJ in the 80’s and college in Puerto Rico. I got my degree in Biology but worked as an at-home over-the-phone interpreter for over 20 years. Currently I’m studying web development and painting.</p>
            <p>When I started to watercolor again I wanted to brush up on my drawing so I took a couple of courses. During one of these courses I realized how much I enjoyed the perspective drawing exercises.</p>
            <p>Searching for perspective drawings on the internet I came across Zak Korvin, he posts videos on how to draw these geometric shapes and symbols. Check him out at zakkorvin.com. I got interested in sacred geometry and learned that the idea of expressing music geometrically has been around for quite a while so the artist in me thought that color could be expressed geometrically as well.</p>
            <p>This site will present my work as I intent to faithfully express color geometrically. To get things started, I found that I should only use primary and secondary colors. Their numbers (3 and 3) and their combinations seem to fit well into the shapes and symbols. Feel free to follow me on twitter and instagram, I wont storm your feeds.</p>
