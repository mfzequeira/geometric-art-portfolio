            <p>I was born in Puerto Rico and raised in the United States. I went to high school in NJ in the 80’s and college in Puerto Rico. I got my degree in Biology but worked as an at-home over-the-phone interpreter  for over 20 years. Currently I’m studying web development and painting.</p>
            <p>One of the first thing I did when I satarted to watercolor was to brush up on my drawing with a course from thegreatcourses.com. It was during this course that I realized how much I enjoyed perspective drawings. The use of a T-square, triangle, and ruler alone to make these awsome drawings peaked my interest.</p>
            <p>Searching for perspective drawings on the internet I came across zakkorvin.com .  He posts videos on how to draw these shapes and symbols. Researching sacred geometry I learned that the idea of expressing music geometrically excisted, and with the well known connection of nature with geometry on my mind, I thought that color could have some sort of connection with geometry ass well.</p>
            <p>These are my first studies. I only use primary and secondary colors. I find that their numbers (3 and 3) and their combinations seem to fit well into the shapes and symbols. I hope you enjoy them.</p>
