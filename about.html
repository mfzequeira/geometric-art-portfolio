            <p>I was born in Puerto Rico and raised in the United States. I went to high school in NJ in the 80’s and college in Puerto Rico. I got my degree in Biology but worked as an at-home over-the-phone interpreter for over 20 years. Currently I’m studying web development and painting.</p>
            <p>When I started to paint again I wanted to brush up on my drawing so I took a couple of courses. During one of these courses I realized how much I enjoyed the perspective drawing exercises.</p>
            <p>Searching for perspective drawings on the internet I came across zakkorvin.com. I got interested in sacred geometry and learned that the idea of expressing music geometrically has been around for quite a while.</p>
            <p> That idea, and knowing that nature can be expressed geometrically, made me think that color could also be expressed geometrically. On this site I will post my progress as I set out to faithfully express color geometrically.</p>
