            <p>I was born in Puerto Rico and raised in the States. I went to high school in NJ in the 80’s and college in Puerto Rico. I got my degree in Biology but worked as an at-home over-the-phone interpreter for more than 20 years. Currently I’m studying web development and painting.</p>
            <p>When I started painting again I wanted to brush up on my drawing so I took a couple of courses. During one of these courses I realized how much I enjoyed perspective drawings.</p>
            <p>Searching perspective drawings on the internet I came across zakkorvin.com .  He posts videos on how to draw these geometric shapes and symbols. I got interested in sacred geometry and learned that the idea of expressing music geometrically existed from long ago, so the artist in me thought that color could have some sort of connection with geometry as well.</p>
            <p>This site, with its twitter and instagram accounts, will document the process of my quest to prove this theory right. To get things started, I found was that I should only use primary and secondary colors. Their numbers (3 and 3) and their combinations seem to fit well into the shapes and symbols. I hope you enjoy the paintings. Feel free to follow, I wont storm your feeds.</p>
