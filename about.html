            <p>I was born in Puerto Rico and raised in the United States. I went to high school in NJ in the 80’s and college in Puerto Rico. I got my degree in Biology but worked as an at-home over-the-phone interpreter for over 20 years. Currently I’m studying web development and painting.</p>
            <p>When I started painting I took a couple drawing courses. During one of these courses I realized how much I enjoyed the perspective drawing exercises.</p>
            <p>Searching for perspective drawings on the internet I came across Zak Korvin, he posts videos on how to draw these shapes and symbols. It got me interested in sacred geometry. One of the first things I learned was that the idea of expressing music geometrically has been around for quite a while.</p>
            <p>That idea, and knowing that the geometric expression of nature has been proven, made me think that color could also be expressed geometrically. On this site, and on the accompanying social media (below), I will post my progress as I explore the boundary between color and geometry.</p>
