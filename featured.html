        <h3>Sri Yantra</h3>
        <p>The Sri Yantra is a mystical diagram. It consists of nine interlocking triangles - four upward ones which represent Shiva, and five downward ones representing Shakti. In my representation you can see the mixing of varnas in the middle two triangles and the separation of heaven (dipicted in blue) and earth (dipicted in red).</p>

        <h3>The Seed of Life Variation</h3>
        <p>The seed of life is painted here to reveal six green and yellow chalices. Christians have used the chalice since the early church. In Unitarian Universalism, they are used in many congregations by lighting a flame inside them. In Wicca, it represents the feminine principle and is usually combined with a ceremonial black-handled knife (the male principle). Combining the two evokes the act of procreation, a symbol of universal creativity. In Rastafarian, the Rastafaris sometimes smoke ganja in a chalice (or water pipe) in activities called reasoning intended to put participants in touch with peaceful feelings, unity, and consciousness. </p>

        <h3>Five pentagrams in a pentagon</h3>
        <p>In this painting I colored the pentagrams to appear as stars. The Spirit (depicted by the color yellow) and the people (depicted by the color purple) are central and on top, and earth (red) is above heaven (blue).</p>

        <h3>Hidden Dodecahedron</h3>
        <p>In geometry, the dodecahedron is a polyhedron with twelve flat faces. The one almost hidden in this painting is a regular dodecahedron with regular pentagons as faces. Drawn without using Metatron’s Cube, the pedals are part of the drawing and not drawn by hand. In Sacred geometry, it is the fourth platonic solid and is the symbol for the universes or a framework for the descending subtle energies of spirit or ether.</p>

        <h3>Out of the blue</h3>
        <p>An original radiating star pattern inspired by zellige shapes commonly seen in Morrocan tiles. Looking at the middle, it will look like the four blue squares are coming out of the red forms. "From Earth to Heaven, people travel, no matter how many demons surround them." </p>

        <h3>12 plus 1</h3>
        <p>My first original symbol. Twelve circles surround one in the middle. In sacred geometry, the number 12 is what holds this material world together. In tarot, it’s the wheel of fortune, this wheel holds together all aspects of life, from identity, money, and love to friendship, children, and family. In astrology, there are 12 houses in which the planets and the 12 signs travel. Others include the number of knights at The Round Table. 12 tribes of Israel. 12 Apostles. 12 names for the monkey God Hanuman.</p>

        <h3>Heaven and Earth</h3>
        <p>This original design was inspired by a video posted by Knew Geometry on YouTube and made by drawing Kepler’s Triangle, the Great Pyramid, and squaring the circle. It has a circle, a triangle, and a square, one on top of the other. For this painting, the blue circle represents Heaven, the red square represents the Earth, and the Yellow triangles represent the space between.</p>
