        <h3>Vesica Pisis</h3>
        <p>In sacred geometry, creation began with a central point referred to as The Spirit or God and a surrounding circle. When the spirit moved to the edge of the circle it created another circle. This is the shape it makes. It’s called vesica piscis because the space where the two circles overlap looks like the bladder of a fish.</p>

        <h3>Egg of Life</h3>
        <p>The egg of life is the second iteration of creation in sacred geometry. It represents new life, health, and fertility. It embodies the idea of rebirth and rejuvenation in the cycle of life. Here, the blue and the red parts of the vesica piscis from the previous image are divided by three. This shape can be infinitely large and small, also giving a new meaning to the cycle of life.</p>

        <h3>Fruit of Life</h3>
        <p>The fruit of life is the holiest shape in sacred geometry because it is hidden behind the flower of life. It’s the third iteration in creation and here it looks like the six spheres around the center one multiplied and arranged themselves in lines moving outward.</p>

        <h3>Metatron's Cube</h3>
        <p>Metatron’s Cube represents the final stage of a cycle of immobility. It is a figure composed of 13 equal circles with lines from the center of each circle extending to the center of the other 12 circles. Because it looks the same from any perspective, it is considered the truth. The legend associated with the name comes predominantly from Kabbalistic texts where it is used as the name of the Prince of Presence, Michael the archangel, and Enoch after his bodily ascent into heaven.</p>

        <h3>Germ of Life</h3>
        <p>Found within the seed of life (next shape), the germ of life is the interconnection of life on earth that originated from a single source in a divine plan. It is the result of all the connections from the previous symbol—the yellow mixed with the blue to produce green as presented in between them. The red and blue mixed to make purple, and the red mixed with the yellow to create orange.</p>

        <h3>Seed of Life</h3>
        <p>The seed of life is a universal symbol of creation. It contains the wisdom of growth, development, and creativity. It follows the germ of life, and one can almost see how it has grown. This painting inspired me to study how color and geometry interact.</p>

        <h3>Tree of Life</h3>
        <p>The tree of life represents the afterlife and the connection between heaven (depicted here in blue) and earth (red). It represents harmony, balance, and connection between the physical and spiritual worlds and supports all life. We can find it in various cultures, including Vikings, Egyptians, Celts, Native Americans, Jewish mystics, etc. In this series, we can see that after the Seed of Life, angels and devas (green) have a central role between The Spirit (Yellow) and earth. More on this and what I have discovered studying color and geometry in future posts or on my website. Note: this colored symbol is my first draft and is subject to change.</p>

        <h3>Merkaba</h3>
        <p>After the beginning of life and the afterlife, beings need a way to communicate with heaven. Enter the Merkaba. The word Merkaba denotes the notion of a chariot in Hebrew and appears in the Bible when prophets ascend towards the sky in chariots of fire. In sacred geometry, the symbol is of two intersecting tetrahedrons that spin in opposite directions. It combines opposing forces in perfect balance. This union in harmony activates the light that can transport us to higher dimensions.</p>

        <h3>64 Tetrahedron</h3>
        <p>After establishing the connection between heaven and earth, we get the 64 Tetrahedron. In this image, we still see the separation between heaven and earth. The blue represents heaven which is above the world in red. The other colors also represent unchanging entities—more on this to come. Back to the image, the lines that connect and surround all the points represent the connections established by the previous shape; the next shape, the flower of life, Which incidentally is the most sacred shape in sacred geometry, shifts the location of heaven and earth for a more balanced Structure.</p>
